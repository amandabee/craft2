Very rough notes on putting together a coherent package

I didn't  pull out either of these two packages, but they're both good examples of cohesive packages that include a variety of media:
 
http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/under-the-gun/ and http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/
 
I also didn't talk about any of the work Brian Boyer has been doing at NPR with tumblr, but it is worth learning from:

+ http://cookyourcupboard.tumblr.com/

And these are the packages I did walk through
