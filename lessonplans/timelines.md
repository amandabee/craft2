# Timelines

## As Storytelling

[Lena Groger gave a great talk](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/timelines/timelines.html) at NICAR 2013.    

### Examples:

+ <http://jour72312.tumblr.com/tagged/timeline>
+ <http://craft-ii.tumblr.com/tagged/timeline>

+ [Lehman Bros that went bust](http://www.lisamahapatra.com/2013/09/13/infographic-the-bros-of-lehman-brothers-where-are-they-now/)
+ [history of the telephone](http://www.powwownow.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/History-of-The-Telephone1.jpg)
+ [GOOD Magazine makes beautiful ones that are not very web friendly](http://awesome.good.is.s3.amazonaws.com/transparency/web/0906/trans0609largestbankruptcies.jpg)
+ [NBC news on Bin Ladin](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42853015/ns/world_news/t/timeline-osama-bin-ladens-life/#.USwgoRyY5n1)


### Discuss:

+ Consistent Tone (use the future tense or the past or the present, but don't switch around)
+ Redundancy (don't repeat information)
+ You still need to decide what the reader needs to know; you still have to edit

## To organize your work
Keep track of the order of events for your own sanity. Even if you're never going to publish it, keeping track of the order of events is incredibly useful. 


## Tools
[Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) or [WNYC's Vertical Timeline](http://johnkeefe.net/the-thinking-behind-wnycs-new-vertical-timeli)

Radiolab used Timeline.JS: http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blogland/2012/jun/29/color-walk/
SanAntonio Express used Timeline.js, but they didn't make it easy for us to find the rest of the story (don't assume you control the path your readers take)
[Timeline](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/data_central/item/Money-Laundering-8792.php) and [Slideshow](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/S-A-ties-to-drug-cash-detailed-3483020.php)


ProPublica [built “Timeline Setter”](http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/2012/01/10/tool-of-the-week-for-journlaists-propublicas-timeline-setter/) to take a formatted spreadsheet and move it into a horizontal timeline. [It isn't perfect](https://www.propublica.org/special/tbi-psycho-platoon-timeline), but it does let you walk through the content. And they've been building on it. 
They also used it to illustrate a [history of presidential pardons](http://www.propublica.org/special/timeline-a-history-of-pardons). 


Riffing off of ProPublica's work, WNYC built a vertical timeline tool. In 2012,then-state senate majority leader Pedro Espada got in big trouble for siphoning money out of a charitable organization he was running.

Mother Jones took the same tool and used it to cover [Mitt Romney's record](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/mitt-romney-bain-capital-timeline)

### More advanced Tools
ProPublica's Timeline Setter and CartoDB's Torque are more complex -- if you want to get skilled at tools like that, take Amanda's DataViz class. 

## Hands On
Pick one story you're working on and make a timeline using Timeline.JS with at least 5 key dates in it. If you don't have a single story that has dates or times worth working with, look at the recent building explosion in Harlem, or the missing Malaysian Airlines flight and make a timeline out of one or the other of those two stories.
